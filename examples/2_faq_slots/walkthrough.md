# Example 2: Slot-Based FAQ

This example introduces **Slots** to parameterize a FAQ. Instead of separate states for "Carry-On Policy" and "Checked Bag Policy", we use one state and an LLM-generated response based on the `bag_type` slot.

## Scenario
An airline baggage bot. It asks the user for the bag type and gives a specific answer.

## Features Used
*   **Slot Extraction**: `select_bag_type` intent extracts `bag_type`.
*   **Conditional Transition**: Flow moves to `baggage_policy` only if `bag_type` is captured.
*   **Dynamic Response**: `response_prompt` uses `{bag_type}` to instruct the LLM.
*   **Context Clearing**: Going back to menu clears the slot so the user can ask about a different bag.

## Walkthrough

**Bot**: "What kind of baggage do you have a question about?"

**User**: "Tell me about carry-on."
*   **Intent**: `select_bag_type`
*   **Slot**: `bag_type` = "carry-on"
*   **Transition**: `baggage_menu` -> `baggage_policy`
*   **Bot**: "Carry-on must fit under the seat." (Generated by LLM)

**User**: "What about checked bags?"
*   **Intent**: `another_question`
*   **Context Update**: Clears `bag_type`.
*   **Transition**: `baggage_policy` -> `baggage_menu`
*   **Bot**: "What kind of baggage do you have a question about?"

**User**: "Checked"
*   **Intent**: `select_bag_type`
*   **Slot**: `bag_type` = "checked"
*   **Transition**: `baggage_menu` -> `baggage_policy`
*   **Bot**: "Checked bags cost $30."
